Under construction

## Join the TheoEvoBio Group!

I am always eager to collaborate with postdoctoral researchers and students—PhD, master’s, and bachelor’s—who are keen to work on theoretical projects in any of my research areas: cancer ecology & evolution, the evolution of ageing, and cultural evolution. If you are interested, please email me to explore opportunities.

## Working together

We will co‑design a project that fits your interests and the skills you want to build. I enjoy brainstorming, and encourage curiosity, independence, critical thinking, and initiative. I adapt my supervision to individual needs: early stages involve closer guidance, transitioning to a coaching role as you gain autonomy. We practice open science: preprints, open data and code (e.g., GitHub), and active dissemination at conferences or public‑engagement events are strongly encouraged.

## Meetings & communication

• Frequency: Weekly or bi‑weekly meetings, with mutually agreed deadlines.
• Preparation: Please send an agenda at least one day in advance.
• Follow‑up: Share a concise summary of our discussion and the next steps.
• Day‑to‑day: Slack (you’ll be added) or email. I aim to reply within one working day.
• Feedback: For detailed feedback, notify me ahead of time so I can reserve focused hours.

## Resources & funding

You will have access to office space and the high performance computing cluster Hábrók (https://www.rug.nl/society-business/center-for-information-technology/research/services/hpc/habrok?lang=en). Limited funds for conference travel are available and allocation will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

## Professional development

I am happy to support your broader academic and career goals and can:
• Advise on study trajectories and career planning.
• Review fellowship or grant applications.
• Write recommendation letters.
• Involve you in teaching (e.g. TA-ing or guest lectures), outreach, supervision, or side projects—just let me know your interests.

## Work-life balance, well-being, and inclusivity

Good science thrives on balance and rest. While I sometimes keep unconventional hours, I respect yours and do not expect work or responses outside your schedule. Meetings will not be set on public holidays, and I encourage you to take annual leave. Urgent deadlines will be handled together.

Having navigated life abroad, minority identities, neurodiversity, and bereavement, I understand that personal challenges arise. If anything affects your work, please talk to me. We will seek appropriate accommodations and support.

Our group values diversity, equity, and inclusion. Discrimination, harassment, or hate of any kind is not tolerated. If you witness or experience such behaviour, contact me immediately—your safety comes first.

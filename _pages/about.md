I am a theoretical evolutionary biologist and work at Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences ([GELIFES](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/?lang=en)) of [Universiy of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), as a tenure-track assistant professor. 

Website very much under construction!

## Research

I am broadly interested in applying theoretical approaches (mathematical modelling & computer simulation) to tackle different biological questions. I primarily work on cancer, ageing, life history evolution, and cultural evolution.  

## Teaching

I teach a variety of courses, covering both modelling approaches (e.g. Evolutionary Theory, Programming C++ for Biologists), and different aspects of evolutionary biology (e.g. Evolutionary Medicine: Diseases of Affluence, Evolutionary Processes). I also take an active role in teaching organisation as a member of the BSc Biology Programme Committee at the University of Groningen.

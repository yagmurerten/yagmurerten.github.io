    I am a PhD student interested in using mathematical models to answer questions in evolutionary ecology. I work mainly on the evolution of sex, and on evolutionary conflicts of different flavours. I have worked previously on evolutionary transitions in individuality in endosymbioses, which has left me with an enduring interest in mutualisms and cooperation. I am from the southern Indian city of Bangalore, and outside the lab I enjoy bread-baking, sports, and trying new hobbies.
